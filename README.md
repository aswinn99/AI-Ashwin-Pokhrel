# AI-assignment I & II

**Machine learning** is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of machine learning generally is to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by people.

Although machine learning is a field within computer science, it differs from traditional computational approaches. In traditional computing, algorithms are sets of explicitly programmed instructions used by computers to calculate or problem solve. Machine learning algorithms instead allow for computers to train on data inputs and use statistical analysis in order to output values that fall within a specific range. Because of this, machine learning facilitates computers in building models from sample data in order to automate decision-making processes based on data inputs.

Any technology user today has benefitted from machine learning. Facial recognition technology allows social media platforms to help users tag and share photos of friends. Optical character recognition (OCR) technology converts images of text into movable type. Recommendation engines, powered by machine learning, suggest what movies or television shows to watch next based on user preferences. Self-driving cars that rely on machine learning to navigate may soon be available to consumers.

Machine learning is a continuously developing field. Because of this, there are some considerations to keep in mind as you work with machine learning methodologies, or analyze the impact of machine learning processes.

In this tutorial, we’ll look into the common machine learning methods of supervised and unsupervised learning, and common algorithmic approaches in machine learning, including the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, decision tree learning, and deep learning. We’ll explore which programming languages are most used in machine learning, providing you with some of the positive and negative attributes of each. Additionally, we’ll discuss biases that are perpetuated by machine learning algorithms, and consider what can be kept in mind to prevent these biases when building algorithms.
The “learning” in machine learning refers to a process in which machines review existing data and learn new skills and knowledge from that data. Machine learning systems use algorithms to find patterns in datasets, which might include structured data, unstructured textual data, numeric data, or even rich media like audio files, images and videos. Machine learning algorithms are computationally intensive, requiring specialized infrastructure to run at large scale.

**Machine Learning Methods**
Below are the main disciplines in machine learning. Most machine learning algorithms fall into one of these categories:

Categorization of Machine Learning Algorithms

**1. SUPERVISED LEARNING**
Use supervised learning if you know in advance what you want to teach a machine. This typically requires exposing the algorithm to a huge set of training data, letting the model examine the output, and adjusting the parameters until getting the desired results. You can then test the machine by letting it make predictions for a “validation data set”, or in other words, new unseen data.Common supervised learning tasks typically implement prediction, regression, or classification. A few examples of business  applications of supervised learning:
In the financial industry, machine learning can analyze historical data and then identify the financial risk of organizations and individuals.
In the marketing industry, machine learning can analyze past behavior patterns, then predict customers’ behavior and personalize the experience.
In the knowledge management field, machine learning helps classify text into categories.

**2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING**
Unsupervised learning enables a machine to explore a set of data. After the initial exploration, the machine tries to identify hidden patterns that connect different variables. This type of learning can help turn data into groups, based only on statistical properties. Unsupervised learning does not require training on large data sets, and so it is much faster and easier to deploy, compared to supervised learning.
Here, are prime reasons for using Unsupervised Learning in Machine Learning:
Unsupervised machine learning finds all kind of unknown patterns in data.
Unsupervised methods help you to find features which can be useful for categorization.
It is taken place in real time, so all the input data to be analyzed and labeled in the presence of learners.
It is easier to get unlabeled data from a computer than labeled data, which needs manual intervention.

**Categorizing on the basis of required Output**

Another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machine-learned system:  

**1.Classification:** When inputs are divided into two or more classes, the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are “spam” and “not spam”.

**2.Regression:** Which is also a supervised problem, A case when the outputs are continuous rather than discrete.

**3.Clustering:** When a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task.

Machine Learning comes into the picture when problems cannot be solved by means of typical approaches.  ML algorithms combined with new computing technologies promote scalability and improve efficiency.  Modern ML models can be used to make predictions ranging from outbreaks of disease to the rise and fall of stocks.
